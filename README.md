# Software Engineering Project: Dog Show

Authors: [Sylphrena Kleinsasser](https://github.com/sylphrena0), [Dominick Garcia](https://github.com/DomG06)
Instructor: [Dr. Krish Pillai](https://www.lycoming.edu/faculty/pillai-krish.aspx)

This repository contains the source code for an application produced for the 2023 Software Engineering Capstone at Lycoming College. The application was built according to specifications outlined in the [Project Request for Proposals](https://github.com/sylphrena0/dogshow/blob/master/Request%20for%20Proposals.pdf). The intitial UI design we created for this project is available on [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/162Y0hAee3gJy2oXr8UxHopVxCYejSRz8XLDjT958Fn4/edit#slide=id.g181d91624ff_0_23).

**Dependancies:**
 - [MigLayout](https://github.com/mikaelgrev/miglayout)
 - [SQLite JDBC Driver](https://github.com/Willena/sqlite-jdbc-crypt)
 - [FlatLaf](https://github.com/JFormDesigner/FlatLaf)
